    <h2>what is trash.town?</h2>
    <h3>a place to socialize</h3>
    <p>as a tilde server, the primary goal is to be a place to socialize and be with friends</p>
    <h3>an installation art project</h3>
    <p>many tildes run as virtual instances on cloud services; trash.town will not. it will be a
    physical computer existing in a physical space and will be a source of physical and digital
    art</p>
    <h3>a statement on reuse</h3>
    <p>e-waste is becoming more and more of a problem every day. trash.town will fight against the
    idea that a computer's life ends because of being outdated. a computer can have life breathed
    into it if we are creative about our solutions.</p>
    <h2>goals and parameters</h2>
    <h3>reuse everything</h3>
    <p>every component of the machine should be used. our goal is to show that a computer may not be
    the latest and greatest, but can still exceed all expectations.</p>
    <h3>keep costs low</h3>
    <p>there are costs associated with keeping a computer open to the internet for many users, those
    cannot be avoided. the machine, however, should be as cheap as possible. the goal of this
    project is to rely on scavenging and donations to build our machine. if a part must be bought,
    it ideally should be under $15 USD.</p>
    <h3>the machine is a living device</h3>
    <p>as we get new parts, the machine will be upgraded. this means that as the community grows and
    changes, the machine also grows and changes. with all growth, there will be pains. nothing on
    trash.town should be considered permanent, and this impermanence should be considered part of
    the project's core values.</p>
    <h2>hardware</h2>
    <h3>what we need</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>a whole computer (motherboard, cpu, network, storage, memory, case)</li>
      <li>managed network switch (to isolate archangelic's home network from the server)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>currently we need everything to do with a computer to get started. once we have the necessary
    parts, we can start a running wish list.</p>
    <h3>how to donate hardware</h3>
    <p>contact <code>mallory AT archangelic (dot) space</code> with information on the part you have
    and we can coordinate shipping!</p>
